<h1>LeetCode Solutions</h1>

This repository contains my LeetCode problem solutions as I practice and learn coding fundamentals.

I’m a beginner and use this repo to:
<ul>
<li>improve problem-solving skills</li>

<li>understand algorithms step by step</li>

<li>track my learning progress over time</li>
</ul>
Currently:
<ul>
<li>Languages used: C, Python</li>

<li>Structure: Each problem is kept inside its own folder</li>

<li>Status: Just started (more problems will be added gradually)</li>
</ul>
This repository will evolve as I learn more and improve my approach.
